SOLID is an acronym that represents five principles of object-oriented programming and design. These principles help software developers to create systems that are easy to maintain and extend over time. Here's what each letter in SOLID stands for:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should only have one job or responsibility.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Interfaces should be specific to the client that uses them rather than one general-purpose interface.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions. This principle aims to reduce the direct dependency between high-level components and low-level components by introducing an abstraction layer.

To apply the SOLID principles in your coding, you should:

- **SRP**: Write classes that have a single purpose. If you find yourself writing a class that's doing too much, consider breaking it down into smaller classes each with a single responsibility.
- **OCP**: Use abstract classes and interfaces to allow your code to be extended without modifying existing code. Use patterns like strategy, template method, or decorator when appropriate.
- **LSP**: Ensure that your subclasses can be used interchangeably with their base class, without the need for the user to know the difference. Avoid overriding methods in a way that changes the expected behavior.
- **ISP**: Create fine-grained interfaces that are client-specific. Multiple, specific interfaces are better than one wide-ranging interface.
- **DIP**: Depend upon abstractions, not on concrete classes. This often involves using dependency injection, where high-level modules are passed the lower-level modules they depend on.

```csharp
// SRP: This interface has a single responsibility, which is to define the behavior of all accounts.
public interface IAccount
{
    void Deposit(decimal amount);
    void Withdraw(decimal amount);
}

// OCP: The abstract class is open for extension.
public abstract class AccountBase : IAccount
{
    public decimal Balance { get; private set; }

    public virtual void Deposit(decimal amount)
    {
        Balance += amount;
    }

    public virtual void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        Balance -= amount;
    }
}

// LSP: SavingsAccount can substitute the AccountBase without altering program correctness.
public class SavingsAccount : AccountBase
{
    // Additional functionality specific to a savings account.
}

// ISP: An interface segregation example where different aspects of a banking account are split into different interfaces.
public interface IDepositable
{
    void Deposit(decimal amount);
}

public interface IWithdrawable
{
    void Withdraw(decimal amount);
}

// DIP: High-level modules depend on the abstraction, not on the details.
public class BankService
{
    private readonly IAccount _account;

    public BankService(IAccount account)
    {
        _account = account;
    }

    public void ProcessDeposit(decimal amount)
    {
        _account.Deposit(amount);
    }
}
```
