Put yourself into unpleasant situations. Take a cold shower. Only eat potatoes for a few days. This helps to remind you that you need to learn that you shouldn’t focus on external things but only how to deal with them internally. There are no bad things. There is nothing wrong with what happens. The whole will never do something bad to itself. It is completely detached from the concepts of good or bad. By that premise, nothing good nor bad ever happens to you. It is your internal mechanisms that judge it such. Therefore learn to focus on what is internal and not what is external. Happiness comes from the inside and how you react to your surroundings. Happiness attached to anything external results in no control over one’s happiness.
