### What is done
- Reduction of feature space
- Filtering of unnecessary terms
  - Stop words, **based on POS tags, dictionaries, RegEx** --> That's why the enrichment is done before
- Normalization of terms
  - Stemming, case conversion

### Steps to preprocess:
1. Stop word filter (with stop word list for different languages)
2. Snowball stemmer --> Reduces different forms of a word to its common base
3. tag filter --> Filters terms based on tag value
4. case converter
5. RegEx filter
