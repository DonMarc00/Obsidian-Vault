### What is done:
- List of documents --> [[Terminology#^d42882|Bag of Words]]
- Compute frequency
- Bag of Words -> document/term **vectors**
- Extraction  of document field to string columns
- Conversion of terms to strings

### Steps to transform:
1. Create bag of words (bag of words creator)

2. Transform term cells into string cells (term to string)

3. Compute the relative or absolute [[Terminology#^61f236|Frequencies]]
   - TF Node is used
   - The nodes require a bag of words
   - DF computes the number of documents that contain each term
4. Transform bag of words into document vectors (Document vector)

4. Hash document vectors. The indices of terms are determined by term hashing. This creates bit or numerical vector that is streamable

5. Extract document fields as strings. This is focused on categorizing the data.
