This is done by unsupervised learning

### Methods
- Hierarchical clustering
- K-Means / Medoids
- Density based

### Steps clustering
#### Hierarchical clustering
see your work on scenario-management.
• Creates hierarchy for all data points
– Agglomerative, bottom-up
– Combine the “closest” data points/clusters, one at a time
• Hierarchy can be illustrated by dendrogram
• **Applicable only on small data sets (<5000)**
• Complete linkage: combine data object/cluster with minimal
maximum distance
– Finds compact, convex clusters
• Single linkage: combine data object/cluster with minimal minimum
distance
– Also finds concave clusters
• Average linkage: distance between two clusters c1 and c2 = mean
distance between all points in c1 and c2

1. Distance Matrix calculate -> So you can apply the desired linkage approach
2. Hierarchical clustering using the distance column as input
3. Hierarchical clustering view shows dendrogram
#### Prototype-based clustering
• K-Medoids, K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, …
• Data are condensed to a small fixed number of prototypical data
points
• Each prototype represents a subset of data points
**• Applicable on large data sets**
• Number of prototypes (k) must be specified in advance

1. k-Medoids requires distance column
2. Requires specification of k
