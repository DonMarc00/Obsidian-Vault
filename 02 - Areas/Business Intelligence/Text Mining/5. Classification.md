### What
Assigning pre-defined labels to documents
- Categorization
- Sentiment analysis
- Topic assignment
This falls under the category of supervised learning

In the last section we transformed textual documents into a numerical representation (document vectors)

### Methods
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines

### Approach
Partition a part of the original data set to use as test data. We need this because we need to verify that to model can perform with data it has never seen before but is of the same kind as the training data.

1. Partition the data using (Partitioning)
2. Train the data with a learner node (i.e. Decision Tree Learner)
3. Test the model using the test set and a predictor node (i.e. Decision Tree Predictor)
4. Score the model using a confusion matrix
