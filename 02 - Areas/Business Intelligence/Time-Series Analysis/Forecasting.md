### Qualitative
Subjective methods used when no historical data is available

### Quantitative forecasting
**Based on historical quantitative data**
Analysist tries to understand the underlying structure of the phenomenon of interest and then use that historical data for forecasting

Main methods used:
1. Classical TSA: Based on identification of trend, seasonality, study of serial correlation -> **Univariate TSA**
2. Explanatory models: Based on both past observations of the series itself and with other possible predictors -> **Multivariate TSA**
3. Machine Learning Models: Different ANN algorithms used to forecast TSA
