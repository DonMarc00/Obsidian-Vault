### What is game theory?

Game theory is a field of mathematics and economics that studies strategic interactions among rational decision-makers. It's used to understand and predict the behavior of individuals, groups, or even nations when they are faced with choices that depend on the actions of others. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Definition**: Game theory models situations where success depends not only on one's own actions but also on the actions of others. It applies to a wide range of behavioral relations and has been employed in various fields, including economics, political science, psychology, biology, and computer science.
2. **Types of Games**:
    - **Cooperative vs. Non-Cooperative**: In cooperative games, players can form coalitions and make binding commitments, while in non-cooperative games, they cannot.
    - **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric**: In symmetric games, the strategies and payoffs are the same for all players, whereas in asymmetric games, they differ.
    - **Zero-Sum vs. Non-Zero-Sum**: In zero-sum games, one player's gain is exactly equal to another's loss. Non-zero-sum games can have outcomes where all players benefit or suffer together.
3. **Key Concepts**:
    - **Nash Equilibrium**: A situation where no player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged. It's a point where each player's strategy is optimal given the strategies of others.
    - **Dominant Strategy**: A strategy that is the best for a player, regardless of what strategies other players follow.
    - **Prisoner's Dilemma**: A well-known example where two individuals acting in their own self-interest do not produce the optimal outcome.
4. **Applications**:
    - **Economics**: Game theory is used to model markets, auctions, and negotiate situations.
    - **Political Science**: It helps in understanding conflicts, alliances, and voting behavior.
    - **Biology**: It's applied in evolutionary biology to study strategies of survival and reproduction.
    - **Computer Science**: Used in algorithm design, especially in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.
