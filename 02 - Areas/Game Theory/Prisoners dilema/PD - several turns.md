The most rational decision for a player in a prisoners dilemma is to defect because it is in their best interest to cut their losses (most rational decision).

This changes when the game is played out multiple times.

### New example:

A game is played where the players can obtain coins. If both players cooperate they both get three coins. If one of them defects, that player gets zero coins while the other one gets five. If both defect, both get one coin each.

Research by Robert Axelrod has shown that in situations where multiple games are played, it is usually best if both player cooperate.

**The game goes like this:**

Over a random period of games each player makes his decisions and collects points. After all the games have finished, the points of both players are added together which represents the final result. **The goal is to get as many points as possible.** Each player acts selfishly though and has private goals.

The optimal scenario: Both players cooperate all the time.

### Main findings:

Axelrod found out that the best strategy is one called **Tit for tat** which works on three main principles:

- It is **nice** (starts with cooperation)
- It’s **forgiving** (it does retaliate after the opponent defects but only for one turn)
- It’s not a **pushover** (after the opponent defects it will defect on the next turn)

This strategy achieved the best scores in most scenario and was sometimes outperformed by Tit for two tat (Retaliate only after two defects). This was witnessed in a set amount of rounds, a random amount of rounds and even if there was noise in the system (says the opponent meant to cooperate but to Tit for tat it came across defect).

That strategy could explain why most of evolution relies on cooperation even if cooperation is irrational in an isolated game (most animals can only think in the short term and not in future gain)

### Furthermore:

Even if a small population of nice players (Tit for taters) is surrounded by a population of nasty players, the population will start to multiply and slowly take over the population because of its overall better performance.
