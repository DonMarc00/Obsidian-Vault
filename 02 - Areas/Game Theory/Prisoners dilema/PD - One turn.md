### One time play scenario:

Here's the classic setup of the Prisoner's Dilemma:

1. **Scenario**: Two criminals (let's call them Alice and Bob) are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of communicating with the other. The prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge, but they have enough to convict both on a lesser charge.
2. **The Offer**: The prosecutors offer each prisoner a bargain. Each prisoner is given the opportunity to either betray the other by testifying that the other committed the crime, or to cooperate with the other by remaining silent. The possible outcomes are:
    - **Both Betray**: If Alice and Bob both betray each other, each of them serves 2 years in prison.
    - **One Betrays, One Cooperates**: If Alice betrays Bob but Bob remains silent, Alice will be set free, and Bob will serve 3 years in prison (and vice versa).
    - **Both Cooperate**: If both Alice and Bob remain silent, both of them will only serve 1 year in prison (on the lesser charge).
3. **Dilemma**: Rational self-interest would seem to dictate that each prisoner should betray the other. However, if both prisoners follow this strategy, they both serve longer sentences than if they had both cooperated. The dilemma, therefore, is that mutual cooperation yields a better outcome, but it is not the rational decision if you cannot trust the other party to cooperate.
4. **Implications**: The Prisoner's Dilemma is significant because it typically has no clear, dominant strategy and poses a counterintuitive result: that two rational individuals might not cooperate even if it seems in their best interest to do so. It has been used to understand and analyze a wide variety of phenomena in the real world, including business, economics, politics, and biology.
