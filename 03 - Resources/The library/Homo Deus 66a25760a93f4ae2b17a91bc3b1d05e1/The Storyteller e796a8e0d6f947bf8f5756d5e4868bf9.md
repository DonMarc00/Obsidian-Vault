- The Storyteller
    
    It was not the gods themselves that were mighty. Neither were the pharaos or kings. They were nothing more than brands. The gods of ancient Sumer weak because even though they owned land and collected taxes from their subjects, none could remember the exact amount of money that was due and neither did anybody know what sacrifices had to be made.
    
    Only when writing and reading was invinted could vast storys be remembered for a very long time. Intersubjectivity becomes really powerfull if many people belive in the same thing. Only with recordings could widespread storys unfold, which in return raised the amount of people that believed in the same story. Those storys gave more power to the entity that they described, because more people believed in it. The more people believe in something, the more powerful it gets. Moneys value i.e. decreases with the amount of people that believe in its worth. And for that fact, rulers became more powerful. Now due taxes could be written down and remembered for a very long time.
    
    Those rulers were nothing more than brands or companys. The pharaoh controlled the world as does Google now in a way. And even when the pharaoh or the CEO of Google died, business went on as usual. Because the employees of the brand were still alive and all contracts and due amounts of money were recorded in some way. The brand usually does not make many decisions. Its ambasadors do.
    
    This is how storys make rulers and make entitys powerfull!
    
- Living on paper
    
    Writings and documents became so powerful that they could literally decide over life and death of a person
    
    As the nazis took over France in the Second World War many people of France fled and tried to cross the Portuguese border. The consult of the Portuguese consulate Sousa Mendes rejected his superiors orders and for 10 days gave away free visas to every refugee that asked for one.
    
    It was the biggest rescue mission of the Second World War. 30.000 people were rescued. A stamp on a paper literally decided the fate of millions of people
    
- Holy Scriptures
    
    Even though story‘s were originally considered a way to describe reality, they soon became a powerful tool to reshape it.
    
    Take for example the borders of many African country’s. It was not the African people how decided them but rather some Europeans how drew them on a whim. They literally put down a piece of paper, drew some lines and declared them the borders of all countries on the African continent, disregarding the existence of enemy clans in the same country or the flow of rivers or even mountain ranges that would separate communities. And as they declared this map to be official, reality was reshaped.
    
    Abraham Lincoln once said: „You can’t deceive everyone all the time“. Well that simply is not true. The power of written documents reach its apex when holy scriptures were invented.
    
    **If a story includes to much fiction an looses its touch with reality, nobody will believe it. But if the same story just describes facts and has no kind of fiction, none will follow you.**
    
    This fact was literally abused by priests and wise people. They created holy writings that not only described the reality shaped by god, but also told stories of gods commandments and wonders he did. As such a large amount of people started believing in those stories and those same wise people could hold their authority over millennia.
    
- But it works!
    
    Fictions enable us to cooperate better. In return they also what the goals of the cooperation are. So we may have very elaborate system of Corporation, which are harness to search fictional aims interest. Consequently, the systems may seem to be working well, but only if we adopt the system is own criteria.
    
    Hence, when we judge human systems it all comes down to the yardsticks we set ourselves. Do you judge todays society based on a GDP or the overall wealth of the average person or rather on social relations and integrity.
    
    The results might differ massively. This is not to say that fiction is bad. It’s actually the contrary. Remember everything that was told before. Fiction is vital to us humans to enable cooperation on a large scale. Only if many people believe in the same thing can they achieve the “great” things that they did throughout history.
