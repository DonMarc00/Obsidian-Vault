# The Anthropocene

- The animistic and humanistic world-view
    
    The humanistic world-view is one that is very familiar to us, while the animistic strikes most of us as foreign and unfamiliar. There used to live many hunter-gatherer tribes who saw themselves and other animals on the same evolutionary level. They talked to them, they believed that every animal had a soul, was self-conscious and had his own agenda. They shared the forest with animals.
    
    On the other hand, the humanistic view sees animals as lesser creatures. Even in ancient times, many religions saw humanity as protector of the planet and as supreme beings while animals were considered inferior creatures which are only there to satisfy human needs. Those views don’t consider their feelings nor do they consider them self-conscious. We ignore their primordial needs and slaughter them as we please. Animals experience unimaginable agony and we are ok with it as they have no soul or self-awareness.
    
- The unsettling part
    
    As science and medicine moves forward it will most definitely give rise to a new species, which for the sake of the idea, shall be called *Homo Deus*
    
    Deus can appear in many forms. Either as super-intelligent AI, as humans enhanced with mechanical and electric body parts, genetically modified humans which cannot succumb to illness nor disability or they have genes that make them especially smart and strong or just humans, who have conquered death. 
    
    Either way, who is to say that Deus will view us as inferior. To them we might be nothing more than livestock. Or at least animals whose feelings and needs are not comparable in value to those of Deus. Our ancestral needs may become irrelevant. Say sex for example. If Deus is immortal and humans are inferior, why should their be any need for Sapiens to reproduce. It would just lead to overpopulation with a risk of giving birth to sick and weak offspring
    
    Maybe we should take a little more consideration when we interact with our “inferior” roommates.
    
- God is dead yet the soul lives
    
    Even though most of humanity considers god to be dead, the soul still lives on. Because many people need something to distinguish them from our animal friends. In the soul, humans see eternity. Although the idea of a heaven has been dismissed for a long time, for many people it paramount to have some sort of imagination or idea, that eternity awaits every Sapiens. —> Peace of mind
