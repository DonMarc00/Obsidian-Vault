# The Humanist Revolution

In Chapter 7 of "Homo Deus," titled "The Humanist Revolution," Yuval Noah Harari delves deeper into the rise of humanism and its profound impact on different aspects of modern life. Humanism is an intellectual and philosophical movement that emphasizes the value, agency, and experience of human beings. It is based on the principles of rationality, freedom, and individualism. Here, we explore in more detail the various dimensions of humanism as discussed by Harari.

Economics: Humanism has led to the development of consumer-centric economies, where the preferences and choices of individual consumers drive supply and demand. This shift has led to a focus on catering to individual tastes, preferences, and aspirations, rather than adhering to a predetermined set of norms or values. Companies and markets increasingly focus on understanding and predicting consumer behavior to succeed in this humanist economic landscape.

Politics: Humanism has significantly influenced the political sphere, promoting democratic values and systems. The belief in the wisdom of the masses and the importance of individual opinions and participation in governance can be traced back to humanist principles. By valuing each person's voice and opinion, humanism has contributed to the development of more inclusive and representative political systems.

Art and Aesthetics: Humanism has shaped the world of art and aesthetics by asserting that beauty is subjective and that individual tastes and preferences should dictate artistic expression. This belief has led to a more diverse and vibrant artistic landscape, where creativity and self-expression are celebrated over adherence to a single standard of beauty or artistic style.

Ethics and Personal Choices: Humanism places emphasis on individual judgment, emotion, and experience when it comes to making ethical and personal choices. Instead of relying on external authorities, such as religious or political institutions, humanism encourages individuals to follow their own hearts or intuition, valuing personal freedom and autonomy.

Despite its significant impact on various aspects of modern life, humanism has faced challenges and conflicts. Religious opposition, the emergence of new ideologies, and potential threats from technological advancements have all challenged the foundations of humanism. For instance, the rise of artificial intelligence and biotechnology raises questions about the centrality of human beings and the very nature of what it means to be human. These developments could potentially undermine the humanist worldview.

Nevertheless, humanism has been a powerful force in shaping the modern world, influencing the way humans perceive themselves and their place in the universe. By emphasizing the value and agency of human beings, humanism has transformed societies, economies, and cultures across the globe.

Harari does not explicitly outline specific aspects or pillars of humanism. However, he discusses various aspects of humanism and its influence on different areas of life, such as economics, politics, art, and personal choices. Below are the major aspects of humanism that Harari talks about in this chapter:

1. Economics: Harari discusses how humanism has transformed economies by placing the consumer at the center. In a humanist economy, individual desires, preferences, and choices drive the market, and companies must cater to these needs to succeed.
2. Politics: In the political sphere, humanism champions the importance of individual opinions and participation in the democratic process. Harari explains how the rise of democracy and the belief in the wisdom of the masses can be traced back to humanist values.
3. Art and Aesthetics: Harari examines the impact of humanism on art and aesthetics, emphasizing the idea that beauty is subjective and that individual tastes and preferences should dictate artistic expression. This has led to a more diverse and vibrant artistic landscape where creativity and self-expression are celebrated.
4. Ethics and Personal Choices: Humanism encourages individuals to rely on their own judgment, emotions, and experiences when making ethical and personal choices, promoting the idea of following one's heart or intuition. It values personal freedom and autonomy, as opposed to relying on external authorities like religious or political institutions.

These aspects of humanism, as discussed by Harari in Chapter 7, highlight how humanism has shaped and influenced modern society across various domains.

Harari does not specifically discuss the role of war in the context of humanism in Chapter 7, "The Humanist Revolution." However, war and humanist values can be connected in a broader context. As humanism focuses on the value and agency of human beings, it has implications for the way societies approach war, conflict, and diplomacy.

Humanism places a high value on human life and dignity, which can lead to a greater emphasis on diplomacy, negotiation, and peaceful conflict resolution, as opposed to resorting to violence and warfare. Humanist principles can encourage nations to prioritize the well-being of their citizens and the global community, advocating for the protection of human rights and the reduction of human suffering.

On the other hand, humanism can also be used to justify wars and conflicts in certain cases. For instance, wars fought to defend human rights, prevent genocide, or protect democratic values may be seen as aligned with humanist ideals. The belief in the universal rights and freedoms of all individuals might lead some humanist thinkers to support interventions aimed at safeguarding these principles.

In summary, while Harari does not explicitly discuss the role of war in the context of humanism in Chapter 7, the humanist emphasis on individual dignity, freedom, and the value of human life can have significant implications for how societies approach conflict and warfare.
