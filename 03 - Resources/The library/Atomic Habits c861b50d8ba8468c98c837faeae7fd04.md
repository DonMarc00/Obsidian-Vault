# Atomic Habits

### How your habits shape your identity and vice versa

There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change.
The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

Before trains may depart in Japan the conductor as well as all the workers outside the train point to every operational device on the train and outside of it like the rails and the doors. They call say out loud the name of the component and whether it works. This approach reduces errors by 85 percent and accidents by 30 percent. 

Small improvements in accumulation result in big improvements

If you break down everything you do into atomic units, improve them all by 1% and aggregate them, the effects will be big on the overall system or action 

If you get 1% better each day a year you will be 37 times better (exp!)

Conversely small deteriorations result in big loses over time

Good habits Mike time your ally. Bad ones make it your enemy 

If you find yourself struggling to build a habit or break one it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not y

It is not the goal that differentiates the winners from the losers. It is the system they follow

We tend to imitate the habits of three groups in particular:

1. The close
2. The many
3. The powerful

One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior

The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes it. It depends on whether your prediction tells you that you will benefit from it or not. This doesn't have to be right all the time i.e. smoking

**“I am not confined by my wheelchair - I am liberated by it. If it wasn't for my wheelchair, I would be bedbound and never able to leave my house “ → It's all a matter of perspective**

Your habits are modern day solutions to ancient desires I. E. Browsing instagram, posting on Facebook, swiping on Twitter (connect and bond, win acceptance, reproduce) - > For validating business ideas

What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided

The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards

Frédéric Bastiat: “ it almost always happens that when the immediate consequences favorable the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa… Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are it's later fruits “

As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals

The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you are willing to wait for the rewards, you'll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded 

Don't break the chain is a powerful mantra. Continue your habit just to keep the streak going!

Habit tracking also helps keep you eye on the ball: you're focused on the process rather than the result. You are not fixated on getting G six-pack abs, you are just trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person who doesn't miss workouts

Never miss twice

Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it reaffirms your identity 

Goodharts Law: When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

Measurement is only use for the when guides you and edge context to larger picture, not when it consumes you

It takes 50% to go from 100 to 150 pounds lifting weights but only 33% to go back to 100

When the consequences are severe, people learn quickly 

The work that hurts you less than it hurts Others is the work you’re made to do.

by combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition which makes it easier to stand out

boiling water will soften the potato but harden an egg. You can control whether you’re potato or a neck, but you can decide to play a game where it’s better to be hard or soft.

If you can’t win the game change it

our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it they tell us what to work hard on.

until you work, as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success is luck.

Play a game that favours your strengths. If you can’t find the game that favours you create one.

At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over again

There have been a lot of days I've felt like relaxing, but I've never regretted showing up and working on something that was important to me
