‚ö†Ô∏è You tend to remember all the times you were right about someone and downplay all the times you were wrong.
‚Äî> Reflect on this. Ask yourself how many times you were wrong. Look at every instance were you read someone.

<aside>
‚ùó Many times when reading someone there is one real blind Spot: yourself - i.e. you think someone is trying to deceive you so you start to actively look for clues. But in actuality the other person doesn‚Äôt want you any harm and it is just you paranoia.

## Motivation as a behavioral predictor

Motivation can be key to understand why people act in certain ways. They usually act on two kinds of motivation: Pleasure and avoidance of pain. Only insanity has a person acting for no reason!

### Carl Jung‚Äôs theory of the shadow

Carl Jung's concept of the Shadow is a central component of his analytical psychology. It represents the hidden, unconscious aspects of oneself that the conscious ego does not or cannot recognize. These can be both positive and negative traits, desires, feelings, and memories. Here's an overview of the Shadow and its connection to personal duality:

### **1. The Shadow Defined:**

The Shadow encompasses:

- Personal experiences, feelings, and desires that were repressed or ignored during childhood and adolescence due to societal, familial, or individual pressures.
- Traits that are deemed 'unacceptable' by one's conscious self or society at large. This can range from aggressive impulses to taboo desires, or even unrecognized talents and strengths.
- Elements that the ego perceives as inferior or in opposition to one's self-image.

### **2. Personal Duality:**

- Jung believed that for psychological health and individuation (a process of self-realization and self-actualization), it is crucial to confront and integrate the Shadow into the conscious self. This is because denying or suppressing the Shadow can lead to internal conflicts, neuroses, and other psychological issues.
- The duality comes from the inherent tension between one's conscious self-perception and the hidden aspects of the self (i.e., the Shadow). This duality is not necessarily about "good" versus "evil," but rather about the complexity and multifaceted nature of human psychology.
- Integrating the Shadow doesn't mean acting on every hidden impulse. Instead, it involves recognizing these impulses, understanding them, and finding healthy outlets or means of expression.

### **3. Projection:**

- One way the Shadow manifests is through projection. Individuals might recognize and condemn in others the traits they deny in themselves. For instance, someone might despise a colleague's arrogance without realizing that their intense reaction is fueled by their own unrecognized arrogance.

### **4. Encounters with the Shadow:**

- Jung believed that dreams, fantasies, and certain experiences in the external world can provide glimpses of one's Shadow. These encounters can often be disturbing or uncomfortable, but they offer an opportunity for self-awareness and growth.
- Working with a therapist, especially one trained in Jungian analysis, can facilitate the process of confronting and integrating the Shadow.

### **5. Broader Implications:**

- Beyond personal psychology, Jung saw the Shadow at play in societal and cultural dynamics. Collective Shadows can manifest in prejudices, stereotypes, and large-scale conflicts.

In essence, Jung's theory of the Shadow highlights the depth, richness, and often contradictory nature of human psychology. By engaging with and integrating the Shadow, individuals can achieve a more complete and nuanced understanding of themselves, leading to personal growth and improved psychological well-being.

### Insults as labels

What a person insults you with is often times a label about themselves they don‚Äôt want to acknowledge. Knowing that you can keep your cool in such conversations. It is no coincidence that most homophobic people tend to come out as homosexual sooner or later.

### Motivation in terms of pleasure and pain

When you meet someone try to look at there actions as a result of acting on achieving pleasure or avoiding pain. Ask yourself what good thing they gain behaving that way or what bad thing they avoid - or both‚Ä¶

Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory that represents human needs in a pyramid structure. Starting from the bottom, the levels of the pyramid are: Physiological, Safety, Love/Belonging, Esteem, and Self-Actualization.

To apply Maslow's pyramid when reading or interpreting someone's behavior, emotions, or motivations, you can use the following steps:

### **1. Observe Behavior and Context:**

Start by observing the person's behavior and the context in which it occurs. What are they reacting to? What needs seem to be most pressing for them?

### **2. Match Behavior to Needs:**

Compare the observed behavior or emotional response to Maslow's hierarchy. At which level might this behavior or emotion be originating?

### **3. Consider the Basics First:**

Remember that according to Maslow, lower-level needs (like physiological and safety needs) have to be met before an individual can focus on higher-level needs. If someone's basic needs aren't met, their behavior might reflect those immediate, unmet needs.

### **4. Gauge Level of Satisfaction:**

To understand a person's motivation, assess which level of the pyramid they're currently trying to satisfy. Are they seeking safety? Trying to establish connections with others? Looking for esteem or recognition?

### **Example:**

Imagine you have a coworker named Alex. Recently, you've noticed that Alex often comes to work looking tired, is easily irritable, and eats very little during lunch breaks.

Using Maslow's hierarchy:

- **Physiological Needs:** Alex looks tired and eats sparingly. This suggests that his basic physiological needs might not be fully met. Perhaps he's not getting enough sleep or enough to eat.
- **Safety Needs:** If you find out Alex has been facing financial problems, it might mean that his safety needs (financial security) are threatened.
- **Love/Belonging:** Alex's irritability could stem from issues at home or a feeling of isolation, indicating that he might be struggling with needs related to love and belonging.
- **Esteem:** If Alex feels he's not recognized at work, his irritability might also be tied to esteem needs.
- **Self-Actualization:** Given the context, Alex might not be focused on self-actualization at the moment since the issues seem more fundamental.

Based on this reading, to support Alex, you might suggest resources for financial support, offer to listen if he wants to talk, or perhaps initiate group activities to foster a sense of belonging and camaraderie at work.

Remember, while Maslow's hierarchy offers a useful framework, each person is unique, and a range of factors can influence behavior. It's essential to approach such readings with empathy and an open mind.

### Denial as the most dangerous defense mechanism

Denial is often considered the most dangerous defense mechanism because it involves a refusal to accept reality, leading to a distortion of facts and potential avoidance of necessary action. By not recognizing or confronting true issues or problems, individuals can exacerbate situations, miss opportunities for growth, and potentially harm themselves or others.

## The body, the face and the clusters

### The six universal emotions

The six universal human emotions, as proposed by psychologist Paul Ekman based on his research in the 1960s and 1970s, and their corresponding facial expressions are:

1. **Happiness:**
    - Raised cheeks
    - Crow's feet wrinkles around the eyes
    - Upturned lip corners
2. **Sadness:**
    - Downward pull of the lip corners
    - Inner eyebrows raised and drawn together
    - Downturned eyes
3. **Fear:**
    - Wide open eyes
    - Raised eyebrows
    - Open mouth, slightly stretched horizontally or dropped open
    - Tensed lower eyelids
4. **Disgust:**
    - Wrinkled nose
    - Upper lip raised
    - Lowered eyebrows
5. **Anger:**
    - Lowered and drawn-together eyebrows
    - Tensed or narrowed eyes
    - Lips pressed firmly together or slightly parted
6. **Surprise:**
    - Wide open eyes
    - Raised eyebrows
    - Dropped open mouth

Ekman's research suggested that these emotions and their expressions are recognized across diverse cultures, indicating a certain universality in human emotional expression. However, it's worth noting that while these six emotions are widely accepted as "universal," subsequent research and discussions have expanded upon and nuanced our understanding of emotional expression across cultures.

### Cradling and stroking as self-pacification

Any form of cradling, stroking or rubbing movement can be considered as the physical cue of a person to self-pacify. This could mean touching cheeks when the person feels nervous or frightened, rubbing or licking their lips, massaging their elbows, or running the fingers through their hair/beard.

 

---

### Gestures of confidence and self-consciousness

**Gestures of Confidence:**

1. **Open Stance:** Standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and your weight evenly distributed signals confidence and stability.
2. **Eye Contact:** Maintaining steady and appropriate eye contact during conversations shows attentiveness and assurance.
3. **Steady Voice:** Speaking with a clear, steady voice without uptalk or excessive fillers like "um" or "uh."
4. **Firm Handshake:** A handshake that's neither limp nor overly forceful.
5. **Open Gestures:** Using hand gestures that move outward and away from the body, without crossing the arms or hiding the hands.
6. **Taking Up Space:** Comfortably occupying space, either by standing tall or using broad gestures, rather than shrinking oneself.
7. **Mirroring:** Subtly matching another person's gestures or posture, indicating rapport and confidence in the interaction.

**Gestures of Self-Consciousness:**

1. **Fidgeting:** Excessive small movements like playing with hair, tapping fingers, or shifting weight from foot to foot.
2. **Avoiding Eye Contact:** Frequently looking away or down, especially when speaking.
3. **Touching the Face or Neck:** Often a sign of discomfort or nervousness.
4. **Crossing Arms/Legs:** While not always a sign of self-consciousness, it can sometimes indicate defensiveness or discomfort.
5. **Shrinking Posture:** Slouching, hunching over, or making oneself "smaller."
6. **Overly Fast or Slow Speech:** Talking too quickly can signal nervousness, while talking excessively slowly might indicate insecurity about what's being said.
7. **Barrier Objects:** Placing objects (like a drink or bag) between oneself and others as a form of barrier or protection.

---

### The handshake

1. **Strength**: A firm handshake is often seen as a sign of confidence. However, it's crucial to strike a balance. An overly strong handshake can be perceived as aggressive or domineering, while a limp or weak handshake might be seen as a lack of confidence or disinterest.
2. **Duration**: The duration of a handshake matters. A handshake that's too brief can seem dismissive or rushed, while one that lingers for too long can feel awkward or overly intimate. A typical handshake lasts a couple of seconds.
3. **Eye Contact**: Making eye contact during a handshake adds another layer of connection and confidence. Avoiding eye contact, on the other hand, can be seen as a sign of nervousness or evasiveness.
4. **Two-Handed Shake**: Sometimes referred to as the "politician's handshake," using your free hand to cover the shaking hands or touch the other person's arm can convey warmth and sincerity when done right. However, if overdone or used inappropriately, it can come across as insincere or invasive.
5. **Texture and Temperature**: While not always within one's control, a clammy handshake can be off-putting. Some people naturally have colder or sweatier hands, but if it's due to nervousness, it could be perceived as a lack of confidence.
6. **Hand Position**: The position of the hands can convey subtle dominance cues. A palm-down position can be seen as a dominant gesture, while a palm-up position can be perceived as submissive. A vertical hand position is usually the most neutral and preferred in most situations.
7. **Entry and Exit**: Approach the handshake openly and confidently, and ensure you release smoothly without any abrupt or jerky movements.

<aside>
üí° The general principle is pretty obvious: Bodies expand when they feel confident, happy, dominant or comfortable. They contract when unhappy, fearful or frightened

</aside>

---

### Posture

Those postures that take up room and expand are all associated with dominance assertiveness and authority. Hands on the hips, hands held regally behind the back or even arms laced behind the neck as one leans back in a chair - all signify comfort and dominance.

When you are becoming aware of people's body language, ask in the first instance whether their actions, gestures and postures are constricting or expanding. Is the face open or closed? Are the hands and arms spread wide and held loose and far from the body? Or are the limbs kept closed and tense? Is the facial expression you're looking at pull tight or loose and open? Is the chin held high? Sign of confidence or tucked in? Sign of uncertainty.

Imagine you have no words at all to describe what you're looking at. Just observe is the body in front of your relaxed and comfortable in space, or is there some tightness, tension and unease in the way the limbs are held? 

---

### MIrroring

Mirroring is a fundamental human instinct. We tend to match and mimic the behaviour and expressions of those we like or agree with. While we don't, if we dislike a person or perceive them negatively.

## Personality science and typology

### What is an introvert?

At the other extreme are people who draw their energy from themselves and not other people around them. Introverts. Why spend time trying to make conversation with large groups of people when you can be at home with your own thoughts? Introverts aren't shy. They simply prefer solitude to socializing or calm to chaos.

---

### Extroversion and Energy

An extrovert and this energy expression mainly happen in the external world. When in the presence and company of others, extroverts are able to recharge for an introvert. His source of. energy mainly happens in his internal world. Having space to himself or herself is ideal and can prove to be the best mode of recharging that energy expression.

---

### Sensing

Sensing has to do with believing information that is more concrete and tangible over intuition, which is more about looking at the underlying theories or principles that may come out of data. A police officer will always use evidence and data to support the claims for making an arrest, because this information is measurable. On the other hand, a lawyer would exhibit more intuition because there could be a lot more to the context being presented, which helps him defend his clients.

### Practical use of the MBTI

## Lie detection 101 and caveats

Lie detecting is generally most accurate when:

- You have a solid baseline of behavior against which to compare
current behavior
- The person doing the lying is spontaneous, i.e., they haven‚Äôt had
any time to rehearse their lie or prepare themselves
- The lie comes with real consequences for getting caught‚Äîthis
may up the stakes and make liars more nervous

---

Your ability to detect a lie will come down to the way you engage with the person telling the lie. Your interaction needs to be strategic and proactive. The first thing to keep in mind is to use open ended questions to start off with. Let the other person speak first, and often, to give them time to lay out any possibly conflicting facts or threads you can unravel later to prove a lie. 

---

When you increase cognitive load, you are essentially giving the other person too much to think about, so their lie falls apart. A useful technique is to actually state something untrue yourself, and watch their response.

## Using the power of observation

When you‚Äôre dealing with someone new, don‚Äôt try to think too hard about it right off the bat. Just notice what your knee-jerk reaction is, and allow that to then guide you gently to a deeper and more conscious analysis. Give yourself room to challenge anyfirst impressions, but don‚Äôt brush off your instinctive response, even if you can‚Äôt quite explain it!

---

But there are guidelines to follow, and avenues to explore.

- Consider the following questions during your next conversation:
Does the person use a lot of pronouns or mostly talk about
others? Financial analyst Laura Rittenhouse believes that the more
times the word ‚ÄúI‚Äù occurs in annual shareholder letters, the worse
a company‚Äôs performance overall.
- Are the words very emotional and dramatic or plain, neutral and
fact-based only?
Is there a lot of jargon or technical language? What‚Äôs its function?
- Does the person use a lot of ‚Äú$10 words‚Äù when simpler
terminology would work? Why?
- Does the person swear a lot? What does this tell you about the
other data you‚Äôve gathered?
- What does their vocabulary tell you about the particular model or
frame of reference they‚Äôre using? For example, do they call a
disagreement an ‚Äúattack‚Äù or call employees ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù?
- Is the person using words they know you don‚Äôt understand‚Äîor
words that only you and they share? Why? Are they creating
solidarity and familiarity or trying to exclude you in a power play?
- Are pronouns like you, your, yourself being used to blame, direct
attention to someone else, or manipulate?
- Is the person mimicking your language‚Äîare they repeating little
phrases or words you use? This could be a sign they‚Äôre seeking
agreement and harmony.

Those who are night owls have been found to have slightly higher rates of what are called the ‚Äúdark triad‚Äù personality traits‚Äînarcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy.

---

Interestingly, if you‚Äôre trying to assess a colleague or potential hire‚Äôs personality, the advice is to ignore their resume and look at social media. It may not seem fair that people make snap judgments about others‚Äô social media accounts, but there is some evidence to suggest it may actually be an accurate method‚Äînot just for assessing personality, but also for seeing how someone might perform on the job.

---

> Typically, they‚Äôll ask themselves questions, again, such as ‚ÄúWhat
makes me happy and fulfilled?‚Äù Such direct questions should be
considered a mediocre starting point, because these questions
force you to ramble and create an answer out of nothing. It often
doesn‚Äôt lead to much insight other than pretty platitudes. You
might lie or even interpret the question in unhelpful ways.
Seriously, try to answer that previous question in a way that
actually gives you some meaning and direction. What about if you
were asked something like, ‚ÄúWhat parts of your week do you look
forward to the most‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat would you do if you won the
lottery and could choose how to spend your time?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat is
your favorite type of long-term vacation?‚Äù These questions elicit
concrete answers‚Äîspecific pieces of you or other people‚Äîthat you
can work with and seek to delve into. Really, we are asking about
people‚Äôs behaviors, which provide the best basis for understanding
people. Thoughts and intentions are important, but ultimately, if
they are never translated into action, they are useless for our
purposes.

Indirect Questions; Direct Information
And so this chapter provides a novel way to analyze people.
Through innocent questioning, we can uncover a host of
information that represents an entire worldview or set of values.
For instance, what if you were to ask someone where they
obtained their news and which television channel, which set of
publications, which magazines, and which pundits or hosts they
preferred? It‚Äôs a prime illustration of an indirect question that lets
you understand quite a bit about how they think. It involves a bit
of extrapolation and guesswork, but at least there‚Äôs a concrete
piece of information to go on and many concrete associations
with it.
We start this chapter with some of these indirect questions before
going even more in-depth by asking people for stories and seeing
what we can glean from those. These questions are phrased to
challenge and inspire deep thought. They ask people to dive
deeper such that we can begin to understand their behavioral and
thought patterns.

1. What kind of prize would you work hardest for, and what
punishment would you work hardest to avoid?
The answer to this question might help identify the true motive
behind an individual‚Äôs drive. Beyond surface-level things, what is
really motivating people? What do they really care about? And
what type of pain or pleasure matters to them? On an instinctual
level, what really matters the most in both a positive and negative
way? In a way, this answer also reflects values.
For example, gamblers all want one prize: the jackpot. They try
and try again, whether it be with scratchers or slot machines to
try and win the big prize money. Are they motivated by winning
back their losses? Is their hope to become richer than they can
imagine? Do they actually want it, or are they filling a void and
keeping themselves distracted?
Why are they working so hard? You might surmise that their
motivation is the thrill and rush of the risk involved. Do they care
about making steady pay or finding their purpose? Maybe, and
maybe not. When you can dig into what someone wants the most
and why, you can often find what is driving them without having
to ask it directly. The way people answer this question will clearly
tell you their priorities and what they consider pain and pleasure
in their lives.
Look for the emotion behind people‚Äôs answers here, and you can
get a pretty good read on their values. A goal of rising to CEOlevel
doesn‚Äôt just exist in a vacuum‚Äîwhat are the feelings,
emotions, and fulfilled expectations that come from wanting it?
Likewise, wanting to avoid being poor speaks to very specific
desires for security and safety from danger.
2. Where do you want to spend money, and where do you accept
skimping on or skipping altogether?
This answer reveals what matters to someone‚Äôs life and what they
want to experience or avoid. This is not really about the item or
items to be purchased; there comes a point where material
belongings no longer have a use, and it‚Äôs about what those items
represent and provide. For example, sometimes, spending money
on experiences instead of a new purse has the potential to
improve someone‚Äôs overall well-being and outlook on life. Again,
look for the underlying emotions and motivations behind the
answer.
So what do you have no problem splurging on, and what doesn‚Äôt
matter to you? For instance, when deciding on vacation
expenditures, people may opt to splurge on an epic boat
excursion and stay in a shabby hotel. This reveals their desire to
experience an unforgettable moment rather than staying in a nice
hotel with golden toilets, which they view as a waste of money.
Others might opt for the opposite and revel in their creature
comforts while not seeing much of the scenery. In either case,
they‚Äôve used their money to quite literally identify and spend
toward their priorities and values.
Where your money goes is an important part of what makes you
happy, so if you can pay attention to where you let it flow and
where you cut it off, you‚Äôll immediately know what matters to you
on a daily basis. Contrast this question to if you were to ask
someone, ‚ÄúWhat do you value in your daily life?‚Äù Again, there is a
concrete answer here to analyze.
This same principle applies equally to time, money, and effort.
Where these things flow, whether consciously or unconsciously,
represents the values people possess.
3. What is your most personally significant and meaningful
achievement and also your most meaningful disappointment or
failure?
It‚Äôs common that experiences, whether they‚Äôre good or bad, shape
people into who they are. Achievements and failures tie into how
someone sees oneself. Significant experiences also tend to create
their are this kind of person because you did this and succeeded or
We can‚Äôt escape the fact that past occurrences will often influence
our current and future actions. They don‚Äôt have to, but this isn‚Äôt
a book about changing your mindsets. The point is that large
events will reverberate throughout our entire lives.
So this question will get a response about how people view
themselves, for better or worse. Failure will painfully poke
perceived flaws they hate about themselves, while achievements
will bring up the strengths they are proud of.
A career woman who has worked her way up the corporate ladder
might proudly reflect on her accomplishment. Why does she
consider this her greatest achievement? Because she values
independence, resilience, and determination, and that‚Äôs exactly what
it takes to get to that career pinnacle. She looks back to the
things she did in order to get that corner office, and she feels
positively about them.
Thus, the answer about her career accomplishments is actually a
story about the positive traits she utilized in reaching that point‚Äî
her self-identity. You can imagine that the same negative type of
self-identity might unfold if the same woman were to talk about
her failures and ended up in a job that she despised. Those are
the exact things she hates the most.
The way that people answer this question shows who they want
to be, and this is reflected in exactly how their expectations have
either been fulfilled or not.
4. What is effortless and what is always exhausting?
This is a question that is designed to better understand what
people actually enjoy. Something that is effortless isn‚Äôt always an
innate talent, but rather an indication that they enjoy it. On the
other hand, something that is always exhausting is not always
about people‚Äôs lack of competency, but rather a distaste for the
actual activity. Thus, answers to this question can indicate where
people find natural joy and enjoyment, even if they don‚Äôt realize it
themselves.
For instance, as a baker answers this question, she may recognize
her rather mediocre capacity for creativity for blending ingredients
together to make a dessert. Although she is above average, she is
not naturally talented at it, and it has been very difficult for as
long as she can remember. She was not innately talented with
culinary creativity, and yet she finds joy in it such that she is
always driven to it. It‚Äôs challenging but effortless in a way that
she doesn‚Äôt grow tired of.
On the other hand, she may have a natural talent in
understanding and following traditional recipes‚Äîyet it is not
something that she values or particularly cares about. If we were
to look at only her innate talents, we would conclude that she
should stick to only executing the dishes of others. But it‚Äôs simply
not what she values. As mentioned previously, wherever our time,
effort, energy, and money goes, such are our values.
5. If you could design a character in a game, what traits would
you emphasize and which would you ignore?
This question asks what people see as their ideal self and also
what they feel is less important in the world. Imagine that you
have a limited number of points to give a person but six traits to
spread the points across. Which will you choose to emphasize
and bolster, and which will you choose to leave average or even
lacking?
Suppose you have the ability to choose between the traits of
charisma, academic intelligence, sense of humor, honesty,
resilience, and emotional awareness. The traits you‚Äôd choose to
put the maximum number of points in is how you‚Äôd like others to
see you. It may represent your current composition of traits, or it
might be completely opposite to who you currently are. In either
case, it‚Äôs more than likely that this either represents how you see
yourself or how you would like to see yourself. And the other
traits? Well, they simply matter less. In turn, they seek out people
with those traits they like and are less keen to seek out those
with the other traits. There are probably stories behind each of
the traits that people might choose as well.
A related question to ask others is, ‚ÄúWhat traits are common in
other people?‚Äù This question comes from a 2010 psychological
study by Dustin Wood, in which he found that people tended to
describe others with similar traits as themselves. Presumably this
is because people tend to see their own qualities in others. No
one believes that their mental makeup of traits is uncommon, and
thus, they believe everyone has a similar perspective and way of
thinking as them. Answers to this question are a direct insight
into what traits people believe they have, for better or worse.
From there, you know what kind of approach they have to the
world‚Äîkind, generous, distrusting, mischievous, or even ill-spirited.
6. What charity would you donate millions to if you had to?
Answering this question forces one to answer what they care
about in the world at large rather than just in their own life.
Will you donate to an animal shelter or a charity for cancer?
Perhaps you would sponsor a child from a third-world country?
They all say very different things. You might have had a first- or
secondhand experience with any of these causes. Whatever the
case, it shows what matters when people start to think outside of
themselves. You can see a whole sector of the world that they are
concerned about, and this allows you to see how they view their
place in the world. In other words, whose interests do they tend
to prioritize or be motivated by? As always, look to the underlying
emotion.
Being able to ask these questions evokes a deeper connection to
people‚Äôs values, ideas, and awareness. The purpose of asking
these is to, again, examine behavior. These questions guide a
person in thinking about the most relevant aspects of his or her
character. They also make people think beyond predictable
statements and organically stimulate more meaningful thought.
Look beyond the answers and read between the lines. Critical
thinking, evaluation, and reflection are the key skills at play here.
Next, we go deeper by asking people for stories that they
construct, rather than just a relatively short answer, to see what
we can glean from hearing their internal dialogue in full effect.
7. What animal best describes you?
The great thing about this question is that it‚Äôs a very personal
inquiry hidden in plain sight. People are far more comfortable
talking about certain traits they admire in others than they are
about talking directly about themselves. You might also find that
asking this question has people feeling very willing to share
revealing information that they otherwise might have felt too
uncomfortable to reveal.
Something about the distance that‚Äôs created when talking about an
animal can prompt some very forthright and honest answers.
People may inadvertently tell you about who they wish they were
when they tell about their favorite animal. Listen carefully to the
person who says they love dogs but dislike cats. Ask them why,
and their answer will tell you plainly about the traits they value in
others, in themselves, and how they wish to be.
The best way to pose this question is as casually as possible.
Don‚Äôt make it seem like you‚Äôre grilling for a serious answer‚Äî
ironically, this attitude will quickly reach past people‚Äôs defenses
and have them blurting out information about themselves that can
be incredibly meaningful. What they tell you immediately after is
important‚Äîwhatever is top of their mind is the aspect of
themselves they likely see as most important, most relevant or
most fixed.
For example, a person immediately tells you they‚Äôre a bear and
needs no further prompting for them to explain to you why:
they‚Äôre fierce, protect their loved ones and shouldn‚Äôt be messed
with. But if they didn‚Äôt choose a shark, could this mean that they
also see themselves as having a bit of ‚Äúcuddly‚Äù side to them,
too?
On the surface, such questions can seem innocent and playful,
but it‚Äôs this very simplicity that allows people to respond most
honestly‚Äîas though to a Rorschach test. Did they choose a
carnivore or an herbivore? A mythical animal? A pest? A
domesticated animal or a wild, slightly dangerous one? Such a
question adds immense depth and color to your understanding of
the person‚Äîand it does so in their own terms.
8. What‚Äôs your favorite movie?
This is perhaps as obvious on the surface as the previous one,
but many people don‚Äôt stop to truly think about the huge
amounts of information they‚Äôre being offered when people share
things like their favorite films. With this question, people are really
sharing with you the narratives and stories they‚Äôre drawn to, which
in turn show you in a deep way what their inner moral universe
looks like, how they think of the good and bad guys, or even how
they envision their own grand story as it unfolds.
What is it about a particular film that they like? Don‚Äôt simply
assume that they identify with the main character‚Äîit may be the
director or the genre itself that most powerful speaks to them.
And if someone answers, ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs a very obscure independent
Polish film released in the early 40s. I don‚Äôt expect you know
anything about it,‚Äù you can infer a lot even though you‚Äôve never
heard of the film! You can assume that this person values
exclusivity and rarity, and likes to style themselves a connoisseur
with excellent taste (i.e., what other people would identify as an
infuriating hipster!).
Use the answer to this question along with other data you‚Äôre
gathering. What does it mean that the shy, skinny kid in the
corner best loves a superhero film? What would a retired Japanese
mom see in a serious film about the slave trade in the deep
south? The person who tells you their favorite film is a comedy‚Äî
does it mean anything that the comedy they choose is not a
recent one, but one from decades past, that would have been
popular when they were just a child?
9. What would you rescue from a fire in your home?
You know the drill. Your entire home is burning and you can only
go in to fetch one single treasured item, no more. This is another
question that taps deeply into a person‚Äôs most fundamental values
and priorities. Maybe you had a particular person pegged as a
pragmatic, almost emotionally-stunted person until they tell you
they‚Äôd save a single book of poetry.
Crisis and emergency situations have a way of quickly cutting
through the clutter of life. People may appear a certain way right
up until their backs are against the wall. In the film Force a
family finds themselves facing a terrifying but brief threat‚Äîan
oncoming avalanche. In the few heated moments, the father fleas
the scene, saving himself, while the mother stays with her
children. Though the danger passes and everyone is soon safe
again, the rest of the movie explores what the father‚Äôs actions
mean‚Äîdid his knee-jerk response in the moment say something
about what he really valued‚Äîi.e., himself, and not his family?
Try to understand not just what a person would save, but why. A
person who would quickly grab their pet cat before anything else
is telling you that they value life more than inanimate
possessions. A person who grabs their passport is telling you that
they see their freedom to move, their ability to travel, as a very
special thing.
Similarly, someone who simply tells you they‚Äôd grab their wallet
because they had all their money, cards and driver‚Äôs license in
there is also telling you something important‚Äîthat they are
interpreting your question not in terms of values or hypotheticals,
but as a literal and practical dilemma to be solved in the most
logical way possible. Very different from the person who boldly
claims they would save an old photograph of their great-greatgrandmother!
10. What scares you most?
Many of the above questions are focused on values, principles,
priorities, desires. But of course, you can also learn a lot about a
person by what they actively avoid, detest and fear. This tells you
not only what they do value, but also how they see themselves.
After all, it makes sense that you would fear the thing you most
felt unable to protect yourself against, or the thing that you felt
was most harmful to you personally. This can yield enormous
amounts of insight into how a person sees their own strengths
and limitations.
Someone who says ‚Äúspiders‚Äù is going to have a very different
psychological makeup than someone who claims, ‚Äúearly onset
dementia, where I gradually forget who I am and the faces of
everyone I used to love.‚Äù Fears are often a door to people‚Äôs most
firmly held principles‚Äîa person who is extremely morally-inclined
and driven by justice and fairness might fear serial-killers,
psychopaths or even demonic supernatural entities.
On the other hand, fears can also tell you what that person
thinks of their ability to handle adversity or suffering. The person
who fears rejection, abandonment and criticism is telling you that
in their world, psychological harm is more serious than physical
harm. Likewise, what would you infer about someone who
unflinchingly tells you, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not scared of anything‚Äù?
Takeaways
There is a wealth of information we can observe and analyze
when trying to understand other people, but we usually don‚Äôt have
a lot of time to do it. Using small amounts of data to make
accurate assessments is called ‚Äúthin slicing.‚Äù Snap decisions based
on thin slicing can be surprisingly accurate. A good technique is
to trust your initial unconscious reactions (intuition) but
supplement this with more deliberate observations after the fact.
Note the words people use in their texts and e-mails, for example
their use of pronouns, active/passive voice, swearing, accent, word
choice and so on. Also note how emotionally charged someones
words are, and if this amount is appropriate to the context they
are used in. For example, using overly negative language in
seemingly benign situations can be an indicator of bad mental
health or low self-esteem
Read a person‚Äôs home and possessions like you would their body
language and voice: examine the closedness or openness of a
home to determine sociability, for example. Notice both, what
there is an excess of and what is conspicuously lacking in the
spaces one occupies frequently. Personal possessions can make
identity claims, can speak to the way a person regulates their own
emotions, or can be evidence of certain past behaviors or habits.
You can also rely on people‚Äôs behavior online to discern what kind
of person they are, albeit some caution is necessary here. Pay
attention to what kind of pictures people post and the emotions
they convey, especially whether they are positive, neutral, or
negative. People who post positive pictures are more likely to be
agreeable, extroverted, or conscientious, whereas people with more
neutral photos are generally higher on openness and neuroticism.
You can use questions to actively elicit very useful information.
Hypothetical questions can get around people‚Äôs defenses and have
them honestly revealing insightful information straight away. This
helps you get a better handle on their secret desires, values and
self-perception.
