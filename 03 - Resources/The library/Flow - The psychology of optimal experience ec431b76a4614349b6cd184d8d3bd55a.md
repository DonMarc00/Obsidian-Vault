# Flow - The psychology of optimal experience

## 1. Happiness revisited

## 2. The anatomy of consciousness

## 3. Enjoyment and the quality of of life

Pleasure is an important component of the quality of life, but by itself it
does not bring happiness. Sleep, rest, food, and sex provide restorative
homeostatic experiences that return consciousness to order after the needs
of the body intrude and cause psychic entropy to occur. But they do not
produce psychological growth. They do not add complexity to the self.
Pleasure helps to maintain order, but by itself cannot create new order in
consciousness.

### 3.1 The old italian man

I used to know an old man in one
of the decrepit suburbs of Naples who made a precarious living out of a
ramshackle antique store his family had owned for generations. One
morning a prosperous-looking American lady walked into the store, and
after looking around for a while, asked the price of a pair of baroque
wooden putti, those chubby little cherubs so dear to Neapolitan craftsmen
of a few centuries ago, and to their contemporary imitators. Signor Orsini,
the owner, quoted an exorbitant price. The woman took out her folder of
traveler‚Äôs checks, ready to pay for the dubious artifacts. I held my breath,
glad for the unexpected windfall about to reach my friend. But I didn‚Äôt
know Signor Orsini well enough. He turned purple and with barely
contained agitation escorted the customer out of the store: ‚ÄúNo, no, signora,
I am sorry but I cannot sell you those angels.‚Äù To the flabbergasted woman
he kept repeating, ‚ÄúI cannot make business with you. You understand?‚Äù
After the tourist finally left, he calmed down and explained: ‚ÄúIf I were
starving, I would have taken her money. But since I am not, why should I
make a deal that isn‚Äôt any fun? I enjoy the clash of wits involved in
bargaining, when two persons try to outdo each other with ruses and with
eloquence. She didn‚Äôt even flinch. She didn‚Äôt know any better. She didn‚Äôt
pay me the respect of assuming that I was going to try to take advantage of
her. If I had sold those pieces to that woman at that ridiculous price, I would
have felt cheated.‚Äù Few people, in southern Italy or elsewhere, have this
strange attitude toward business transactions. But then I suspect that they
don‚Äôt enjoy their work as much as Signor Orsini did, either.

### 3.2 The tapping game of Heinz-Meier-Leibnitz

Heinz Maier-Leibnitz, the famous German experimental physicist and a
descendant of the eighteenth-century philosopher and mathematician,
provides an intriguing example of how one can take control of a boring
situation and turn it into a mildly enjoyable one. Professor Maier-Leibnitz
suffers from an occupational handicap common to academicians: having to
sit through endless, often boring conferences. To alleviate this burden he
invented a private activity that provides just enough challenges for him not
to be completely bored during a dull lecture, but is so automated that it
leaves enough attention free so that if something interesting is being said, it
will register in his awareness.
What he does is this: Whenever a speaker begins to get tedious, he starts
to tap his right thumb once, then the third finger of the right hand, then the
index, then the fourth finger, then the third finger again, then the little finger
of the right hand. Then he moves to the left hand and taps the little finger,
the middle finger, the fourth finger, the index, and the middle finger again,
and ends with the thumb of the left hand. Then the right hand reverses the
sequence of fingering, followed by the reverse of the left hand‚Äôs sequence.
It turns out that by introducing full and half stops at regular intervals, there
are 888 combinations one can move through without repeating the same
pattern. By interspersing pauses among the taps at regular intervals, the
pattern acquires an almost musical harmony, and in fact it is easily
represented on a musical staff.
After inventing this innocent game, Professor Maier-Leibnitz found an
interesting use for it: as a way of measuring the length of trains of thought.
The pattern of 888 taps, repeated three times, provides a set of 2,664 taps
that, with practice, takes almost exactly twelve minutes to perform. As soon
as he starts tapping, by shifting attention to his fingers, Professor MaierLeibnitz can tell exactly at what point he is in the sequence. So suppose that
a thought concerning one of his physics experiments appears in his
consciousness while he is tapping during a boring lecture. He immediately
shifts attention to his fingers, and registers the fact that he is at the 300th tap
of the second series; then in the same split second he returns to the train of
thought about the experiment. At a certain point the thought is completed,
and he has figured out the problem. How long did it take him to solve the
problem? By shifting attention back to his fingers, he notices that he is
about to finish the second series‚Äîthe thought process has taken
approximately two and a quarter minutes to play itself out.

### 3.3 Even animals seek enjoyment

Whenever I took our hunting dog, Hussar, for a walk
in the open fields he liked to play a very simple game‚Äîthe prototype of the
most culturally widespread game of human children, escape and pursuit. He
would run circles around me at top speed, with his tongue hanging out and
his eyes warily watching every move I made, daring me to catch him.
Occasionally I would take a lunge, and if I was lucky I got to touch him.
Now the interesting part is that whenever I was tired, and moved
halfheartedly, Hussar would run much tighter circles, making it relatively
easy for me to catch him; on the other hand, if I was in good shape and
willing to extend myself, he would enlarge the diameter of his circle. In this
way, the difficulty of the game was kept constant. With an uncanny sense
for the fine balancing of challenges and skills, he would make sure that the
game would yield the maximum of enjoyment for us both.

### 3.4 The paradox of control

When a person becomes so dependent on the ability to control an
enjoyable activity that he cannot pay attention to anything else, then he
loses the ultimate control: the freedom to determine the content of
consciousness. Thus enjoyable activities that produce flow have a
potentially negative aspect: while they are capable of improving the quality
of existence by creating order in the mind, they can become addictive, at
which point the self becomes captive of a certain kind of order, and is then
unwilling to cope with the ambiguities of life.

### 3.5 The loss of Self-Consciousness

So loss of self-consciousness does not involve a loss of self, and certainly
not a loss of consciousness, but rather, only a loss of consciousness of the
self. What slips below the threshold of awareness is the concept of self, the
information we use to represent to ourselves who we are. And being able to
forget temporarily who we are seems to be very enjoyable. When not
preoccupied with our selves, we actually have a chance to expand the
concept of who we are. Loss of self-consciousness can lead to selftranscendence, to a feeling that the boundaries of our being have been
pushed forward.

### 3.6 The autotelic experience

<aside>
üí° Definition **Autotelic**:

The term ‚Äúautotelic‚Äù derives from two Greek words, auto meaning self,
and telos meaning goal. It refers to a self-contained activity, one that is done
not with the expectation of some future benefit, but simply because the
doing itself is the reward

</aside>

The autotelic experience, or flow, lifts the course of life to a different
level. Alienation gives way to involvement, enjoyment replaces boredom,
helplessness turns into a feeling of control, and psychic energy works to
reinforce the sense of self, instead of being lost in the service of external
goals. When experience is intrinsically rewarding life is justified in the
present, instead of being held hostage to a hypothetical future gain.

## 4. The conditions of flow

### 4.1 Flow activities

What makes these activities conducive to flow is that they were designed to make optimal experience easier to achieve. They have rules that require the learning of skills, they set up goals, they provide feedback, they make control possible. They facilitate concentration and
involvement by making the activity as distinct as possible from the so called ‚Äúparamount reality‚Äù of everyday existence

### 4.2 Flow and culture

**To evaluate a society:** 

If we assume, however, that the desire to achieve optimal experience is
the foremost goal of every human being, the difficulties of interpretation
raised by cultural relativism become less severe. Each social system can
then be evaluated in terms of how much psychic entropy it causes,
measuring that disorder not with reference to the ideal order of one or
another belief system, but with reference to the goals of the members of that
society. A starting point would be to say that one society is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than
another if a greater number of its people have access to experiences that are
in line with their goals. A second essential criterion would specify that these
experiences should lead to the growth of the self on an individual level, by
allowing as many people as possible to develop increasingly complex skills.

**A case were people seek a challenge inspite of giving up security:**

The Shushwap region was and is considered by the Indian people to be
a rich place: rich in salmon and game, rich in below-ground food
resources such as tubers and roots‚Äîa plentiful land. In this region, the
people would live in permanent village sites and exploit the environs
for needed resources. They had elaborate technologies for very
effectively using the resources of the environment, and perceived their
lives as being good and rich. Yet, the elders said, at times the world
became too predictable and the challenge began to go out of life.
Without challenge, life had no meaning. 

So the elders, in their wisdom, would decide that the entire village
should move, those moves occurring every 25 to 30 years. The entire
population would move to a different part of the Shushwap land and
there, they found challenge. There were new streams to figure out, new
game trails to learn, new areas where the balsamroot would be
plentiful. Now life would regain its meaning and be worth living.
Everyone would feel rejuvenated and healthy. Incidentally, it also
allowed exploited resources in one area to recover after years of
harvesting‚Ä¶.
