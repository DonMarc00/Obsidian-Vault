- Hararis unique view on religion
    
    Harari's definition of religion is broader than the traditional understanding. He defines religion as any all-encompassing story that confers superhuman legitimacy on human laws, norms, and values. It's a system of human norms and values that is founded on a belief in a superhuman order. This superhuman order doesn't necessarily have to be a god or gods; it can be natural laws, human rights, or any other kind of non-human force which humans believe shapes the world and determines what is good and what is evil.
    
    Given this definition, Harari argues that not only are traditional belief systems like Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism religions, but so are ideologies like humanism, nationalism, and even capitalism. These ideologies provide overarching narratives that help people make sense of the world, determine moral values, and guide human behavior.
    
    For instance:
    
    1. **Humanism** is based on the belief in the unique value and rights of the individual human being. It's a story we've constructed that places individual human feelings, desires, and experiences at the center of the universe. In this view, what's good or bad is determined by human feelings.
    2. **Nationalism** is a story that gives superhuman legitimacy to the nation. The nation becomes a sacred entity, and its interests and values often take precedence over individual human interests and values.
    3. **Capitalism** is based on the belief in the invisible hand of the market. It's a story that says that as long as everyone follows their own self-interest and tries to maximize their own profit, the outcome will be the best possible one for everyone.
    
    Harari's point is that these ideologies, like traditional religions, provide a framework for understanding the world and guiding human behavior. They're based on certain foundational beliefs that are taken on faith, and they shape our societies in profound ways. By understanding these ideologies as religions, Harari encourages readers to critically examine the stories that underpin our modern world and to recognize the power of these narratives in shaping our futures.
