### A man doesn´t depend on luck

“It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when the luck comes you are ready.”

Anyone can have luck of course, but not everyone one can have determination, skill, and perseverance. Santiago knows this and therefore believes in his ability rather than chance. “To hell with luck,” he thinks. “I’ll bring the luck with me.” He does this by not taking any shortcuts in his work. He keeps his fishing lines straighter than anyone, and he makes sure that, “at each level…there [will] be a bait waiting exactly where he wishes it to be for any fish that swim there.” Santiago keeps his lines with precision, and he is ready for whatever comes.

We cannot attain success simply by waiting for good things to happen. It is when we strive forward towards a goal that we open ourselves up to opportunity.

### A man is not made for defeat

“A man can be destroyed but not defeated”

A man continues to do whatever he must do to the best of his ability, no matter what tribulations befall him. While challenges and setbacks can strip a man of all outward signs of success, still his spirit shall remain undefeated. For it can will a man to never give up and keep trying

### A man bears pain and hardship without complaint

“He was shivering with the morning cold. But he knew he would shiver himself warm and that soon he would be rowing.”

Whether it’s something as trivial as shivering while being cold or as siginificant as skirting along the borders of death, a man simplay does what must be done, without self-pity and without complaint.

Drained, Santiago “settles against the wood” and simply _“_  
takes his suffering as it comes. He is comfortable but suffering, although  
**he does not admit the suffering at all.”**

### A man does not boast

The quality of a man is best seen through his actions, and developing humility is a key ingredient in letting out actions do the talking for us.

Manolin asks, “Who is the greatest manager, really, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?”

“I think they are equal.”

“And the best fisherman is you.”

“No. I know others better.”

“Que va,” the boy says, “There are many good fishermen and some great ones, but there is only you.”

“Thank you. You make me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong.”

And it’s only because of Santiago’s determination that none do. **Boasting only briefly satisfies insecurity. It leaves no lasting impression on the crowd who hears it.**

### A man finds inspiration from others

For Santiago, it is “the great Joe DiMaggio” who inspires and motivates him. He possesses traits that Santiago admires, reminding him that to be successful you have to put all of yourself into a task and bear up under difficulty. Looking up to others–having heroes–provides us with examples to follow, the knowledge that others have overcome obstacles as well, and the assurance of the great possibilities of a man’s life.

### A man goes down swinging - no matter his age

“Now they have beaten me,” he thinks. “I am too old to club sharks to death. But I will try as long as I have the oars and the short club and the tiller.”

Old age is a common excuse, and for certain things it is legitimate, but all too often it is used either where it has no place or before any effort has been made to prove the assumption wrong.

When the sharks begin attacking Santiago’s marlin, at first he fears  
that he cannot defend himself because of his age, but before long, he  
gathers his tools to be used as weapons and does what he must. When he  
breaks the blade off his knife in the body of one shark, the fear sinks  
in again. “Now they have beaten me,” he thinks. “I am too old to club  
sharks to death. But I will try as long as I have the oars and the short  
club and the tiller.”  

And many more sharks do come. He has to  
club and strike them with all of his strength. During the fight, the sun  
goes down and Santiago wonders, “What will you do now if they come in  
the night? What can you do?” He digs deep. “‘Fight them,” he says,  
**“I’ll fight them until I die.”**

Though the sharks do eventually tear Santiago’s marlin apart, they do  
not defeat him as a man, and he never gives up. Paddling in, he tastes  
blood in his mouth, so he spits into the ocean and says, “Eat that  
_galanos._ And make a dream you’ve killed a man.”

Every  
man has sharks that circle him; they gather when they smell the blood  
of real achievement. But you’re never too old to put up a fight.  

### A man’s legacy comes from maintaining his integrity

Santiago drifts away from the pages of this story with exactly the same thing he had when it began: almost nothing. His catch does not bring him money nor “success,” but it does provide him with a legacy that will endure far beyond any monetary gain ever could have. **For he retains his own integrity in the face of great challenge; he exhausts himself in a good fight. A man doesn’t quit.**
