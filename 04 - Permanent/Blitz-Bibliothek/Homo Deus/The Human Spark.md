    Humans are to the dominant species because of their intelligence nor because of their toolmaking skills and especially not because of their strength. Hithertho human has only gotten so far because of his ability to cooperate on a large scale. And even inside human society, it is always an organised group that reigns supreme. Seldom was it the entire revolutionary army or the infantry. This also shows, why disorganised soldiers never revolted against their monarch even though they had the military power.
    
- Charles Darwin
    
    The evolutionary theory claims that all life came from a series of modification and multiplication and subatomic elementary particles in all life forms. As conditions changed, so did atoms and molecules. First they formed bacteria, then organs, then organisms and so on. And with time organisms changed until animals and finally humans arrives. And many people like to believe in that theory.
    
    Yet those exact people also like to believe that there is a soul. The paradox lies in the nature of Darwins theory and the soul. Darwin claims that it is change, that made humans what they are today. Yet the soul is required to be a constant. A never changing thing that remains. That defines every human and makes them unique. Those who believe in Darwin can by definition not believe in a soul. At least it makes no sense.
    
- Consciousness
    
    What is consciousness? We like to separate the mind from the brain. The mind is considered the space of our consciousness. Yet it is not clear, why consciousness is required in the first place from a biological standpoint. If its just algorithms that drive us than why do I need consciousness? If I see a lion than it should suffice for my brain to tell my legs to move quickly and if I see a fruit it should be enough for my brain to tell my hands to climb that tree
    
    Consider the following question: What happens in the mind that doesn’t happen in the brain?  
      
    
    1. Nothing —> Why do we need a mind
    2. Something —> Where does it happen? —> In the brain —> Refer to question
    
      
    
    And if we see it that way, how can one be sure that they themselves are not the only conscious being on this planet. Another person can tell me that he is self-conscious but still, this can only be an algorithm. This begs the question: How can we be so sure that animals aren’t self-aware.? And for that matter: When Deus comes to be, why should it consider us to be self-conscious?
