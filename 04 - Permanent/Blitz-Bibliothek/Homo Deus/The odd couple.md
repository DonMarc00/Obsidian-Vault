- The odd couple
    
    One might argue that science is nothing more than a replacement for old myths and stories and as humanity continues to develop better theories, fiction and reality will advance even more to a degree that they become indistinguishable. For that fact, it will be more important than ever to differentiate the two.
    
- Germs and Demons
    
    Often times, religion gets mixed up with superstition, spirituality and other things of the likes. Yet it is none of those. But it is for that fact, that many people dislike it, when their strongest believe is called a religion. Because they don’t like to associate their most important beliefs with superstition.
    
    In modern times we tend to distinguish between science and religion. We tend to describe them as opposites but they are more a married couple where each one wishes for a more attractive partner but the core problem boils down to one of them not bringing out the trash.
    
    Look at the similarity: In past times people believed in demons that were invisible. If you misbehaved, they would enter your body and make you sick. Nowadays we believe in germs. Invisible microorganisms that are invisible to us. If you don’t watch yourself, they enter your body and make you sick.
    
    It is for that reason that we should be careful while distinguishing between religion and science and not be to harsh on one or the other as they are related
    
- If you meet the Buddha
    
    As the gap between religion and science is actually narrower than we like to believe, the gap between religion and spirituality is actually way wider than we like to believe. - Ironic
    
    Religion is more of a deal. You do this and that and you go to heaven. You do something else and you go to hell. On the other hand, spirituality is considered a journey. It actually talks about letting go of shared believes, conventions and fictions and discover oneself.
    
    This is why Buddhists like to say “If you meet the Buddha on the way, kill him”. Because meeting the Buddha would also count toward believing in and abiding by the same fictions in Buddhism.
    
    For that fact, spirituality is not fit for society or a large group of people but rather for individuals. Letting go of materialistic and bodily desires like wealth and sex doesn’t coincide with the agenda of the collective and one is more likely to become an outcast rather than an icon.
    
- Science and Religion
    
    In Chapter 5 of "Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow," titled "The Odd Couple," Yuval Noah Harari explores the complex relationship between science and religion. He argues that despite their apparent differences and conflicts, science and religion have been intertwined throughout history, each playing a role in shaping human societies and worldviews.
    
    Harari posits that science and religion share a common foundation in that both seek to answer the "how" and "why" questions about the universe and human existence. Science focuses on empirical observations and testable hypotheses to understand the mechanics of the world, while religion provides ethical frameworks and meaning for human life.
    
    In this chapter, Harari discusses how science and religion have sometimes worked together to advance human knowledge and progress. For example, early scientists were often religious figures who saw their scientific pursuits as a means to uncover the divine order in the world. Their work was motivated by a religious curiosity and a desire to better understand the nature of God's creation.
    
    However, Harari also highlights the tensions and conflicts that have arisen between science and religion, particularly as scientific discoveries began to challenge established religious dogmas. Over time, science has increasingly encroached on the territory once held by religion, providing naturalistic explanations for phenomena that were previously attributed to divine intervention.
    
    Despite these conflicts, Harari emphasizes that science and religion have coexisted and continue to do so. He suggests that this odd couple has managed to survive together because they fulfill different human needs – science provides a means of understanding the world and controlling it, while religion offers a sense of meaning and moral guidance. The ongoing relationship between science and religion, according to Harari, is a testament to the complexity and adaptability of human culture.
    
    The existence of science can only be justified by religion because only it can give meaning to science
    
- What is religion?
    
    In "Homo Deus," Yuval Noah Harari defines religion in a broad and somewhat unusual way. Instead of focusing solely on traditional belief systems that involve gods or supernatural beings, Harari expands the definition of religion to encompass any system of human norms and values that is founded on a belief in some kind of superhuman order. This broader definition allows him to include not only traditional religions like Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism, but also secular ideologies and belief systems, such as humanism, nationalism, and even certain economic theories like capitalism and communism.
    
    Harari's approach highlights the commonalities between various belief systems, both religious and secular, and emphasizes their shared function in providing a framework for understanding the world and guiding human behavior. By defining religion in this manner, he encourages readers to consider the ways in which secular ideologies can also function as "religions" in the sense that they offer explanations for the nature of reality, prescribe moral codes, and create social cohesion around shared beliefs.
    
    This broader definition of religion allows Harari to explore the complex interplay between traditional religious beliefs and secular ideologies throughout human history, as well as the impact these belief systems have had on the development of societies, politics, and economies.
    
      
    
    Harari posits that religion offers a deal, a kind of "contract" between humans and a superhuman order. This contract establishes certain rules, norms, and obligations that people must follow in exchange for benefits such as social order, moral guidance, and a sense of meaning or purpose in life. Harari compares this religious deal to the modern state's social contract, which is an implicit agreement between citizens and their government.
    
    The social contract, a concept often associated with political philosophers like Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, is an agreement in which individuals relinquish some of their personal freedoms and submit to the authority of the state. In return, the state provides protection, security, and a framework of laws to maintain social order. The social contract is essentially a deal between citizens and the state that defines their rights and obligations.
    
    In both cases—religion and the social contract—the individual agrees to adhere to a set of rules or principles in exchange for certain benefits. Religion offers a sense of meaning, purpose, and moral guidance, while the social contract provides security, protection, and a framework for social order. Both systems rely on individuals voluntarily agreeing to follow certain rules in order to maintain the stability and cohesion of the larger group.
    
    By drawing this parallel, Harari emphasizes the functional similarities between religious and secular belief systems, illustrating how both serve as organizing forces that shape human societies and provide a framework for cooperation and collective action.
