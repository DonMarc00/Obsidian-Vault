  

- There is no famine
    
    Most people are more likely to die to obesity than to hunger
    
      
    
- War is obsolete
    
    One is more likely to commit suicide than to be killed in a conflict
    
- Death is just a technical problem
    
    The next big milestone in biology will most likely be the conquest of death. As medicine evolves, there is no clear line anymore between curing diseases and inability’s and overcoming death. The collective of medicine will be responsible for that milestone. No single discovery but all together. None will say “Now that a cure for cancer has been found, we will stop here!” As modern medicine strives to cure every imaginable disease death will be overcome. Because death happens for a reason. And if every reason is removed, death in itself becomes obsolete
    
- Why study history?
    
    It was seldom a reason to study history so one can learn from it and avoid mistakes. A mistake made in the middle-ages will hardly be considered one today. Defying god for example is not considered a mistake anymore.
    
    History is studied to understand why the present is as it is. Furthermore one studies history to ask themselves whether it even makes sense for them to be in the current situation. Or if they should actively change course. Take the lawn as example. It is useless, yet almost every house has it. It because in the 17th century it was considered a display of wealth because it was useless. Because a mighty person forfeited valuable land, just to show how wealthy they are. This created stigma. Moving forward in time, it became continuously easier to have a healthy lawn. But the stigma remained.
    
    Now one must ask themselves: Should I refuse to buy a house because it has no lawn? This is where one asks if the current situation even makes sense
